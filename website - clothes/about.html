					<h2>About us</h2>
					<br>
					<p>Il Bavero Tailoring Service owes its beginnings to the passion for elegance and for sartorial men suits. We offer every man that wears a suit the possibility to create the perfect fit. In a few words, it is our pleasure to deliver our clients a unique piece. Our goal is to personalise every part of the suit, allowing you to become the designer. The process of customising starts from the moment you choose our service: we take the measurements, then you can choose the fabrics and linings, and we finish with the meticulous adjustments to the fit of the jacket and the trouser.We make made-to-measure and bespoke suits. We completely customise shirts to order as well as accessories including: ties, pocket squares, boxers, eyeglasses cases, bow-ties. Suits, as well as shirts and accessories, are manufactured in our tailoring studios in Italy. Our Showroom is located in the center of Rome in Via Cola di Rienzo 28 A/3, you can come every day by booking an appointment.</p>
